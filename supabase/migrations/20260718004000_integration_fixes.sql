-- Undo must clear the phantom "in progress" state. The earlier undo_install
-- (20260718002000_install_undo.sql) reverted status/confirmed but left
-- work_started_at set, so Home / MyWork / Dispatch kept showing the opening as
-- actively in progress after a reclaim. Recreate the RPC identically EXCEPT the
-- opening-revert UPDATE now also clears work_started_at. Everything else (void
-- latest install_event, revert status + confirmed, return unit to the truck,
-- void points) is unchanged.
