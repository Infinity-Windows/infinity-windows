-- Phase A — Security hardening (SAFE subset).
--
-- This migration ships only the low-risk, high-value hardening that cannot lock
-- users out or break the running app:
--   1. Lock down profiles.role self-promotion (close the "authenticated = god
--      mode" hole where any signed-in user could UPDATE their own role to owner).
--   2. Pin a stable search_path on every SECURITY DEFINER function (prevents
--      search_path hijacking privilege escalation) — behavior-neutral.
--
-- The blanket RLS replacement (revoking direct table writes / per-table
-- role-scoped policies) is intentionally NOT here. It is high risk because many
-- client calls write tables directly and there is no local DB test harness, so
-- it is deferred to a reviewed follow-up.


-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 1. profiles.role self-promotion lockdown
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- A BEFORE UPDATE trigger blocks any change to profiles.role UNLESS the caller
-- is authorized. Authorized = the caller's OWN current role is elevated
-- (foreman / supervisor / owner, plus the legacy elevated names), which is
-- exactly the check set_profile_role() already enforces — so the sanctioned
-- role-change RPC keeps working while a plain installer can never promote
-- itself (or anyone) by writing the profiles table directly.
--
-- Two escape hatches keep existing behavior intact:
--   * auth.uid() IS NULL  -> service-role / migration context (RLS already
--     blocks anon writes), so seeds and edge functions using the service key
--     are never blocked.
--   * owner-bootstrap emails -> the two founder emails may self-promote to
--     owner on sign-in (mirrors OWNER_BOOTSTRAP_EMAILS in app/src/lib/install/
--     api.ts). Without this, first-run owner bootstrap would be blocked.
--
-- Reads, inserts, and every non-role profile edit (display_name, skill_level,
-- active, pin) are untouched — only a role mutation is gated.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 2. Harden SECURITY DEFINER functions: pin search_path = public
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- A SECURITY DEFINER function without a fixed search_path can be tricked into
-- resolving unqualified object names against an attacker-controlled schema,
-- letting a signed-in user escalate to the definer's (owner) privileges. Every
-- function in this app lives in `public` and already references cross-schema
-- symbols with a qualifier (e.g. auth.uid()), so pinning search_path = public
-- is behavior-neutral.
--
-- This is done dynamically so it hardens exactly the SECURITY DEFINER functions
-- present when the migration runs (the repo has ~22 across all migrations; a
-- live DB behind on migrations simply has fewer, and each is covered as it is
-- created by its own earlier-timestamped migration before this one runs). The
-- second loop also pins search_path on the remaining (SECURITY INVOKER)
-- functions to clear the linter's function_search_path_mutable warnings; this
-- is likewise behavior-neutral.
